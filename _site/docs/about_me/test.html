          I currently reside somewhere in Texas and I am a third year computer
          science student. I plan on graduating in the Spring of 2026. I like to
          write about things that I think are worth reading.

          I've worked multiple creative jobs such as modelling, starting and
          owning two clothing brands, doing graphic design for clients, as well as
          editing videos for clients.

          I am currently studying towards design in technology within programming.
          Aesthetics is what I excel at.
