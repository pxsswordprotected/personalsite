Ever since I was young, I cared about design. When I was eight, I got my first console—the PS3—and I was in awe. The colors, the animations, the profile pictures, even the sound design on the home screen felt intentional, like the creators poured love into every detail.

> I would say with music that's the only thing that inspires me is just that feeling. I'm trying to reclaim the feeling I got when I had *Halo 1* for the first time when I was like seven years old—it's the only feeling I'm looking for.

That first encounter with good design left a mark. Design is everywhere; it shapes how we experience the world. At eleven I had Photoshop on a laptop and made graphics of sports teams, posting them online for fun and for clients. The final images were consistent; my process definitely wasn’t, but I loved every messy step.

This eclectic mindset stuck with me. I’m drawn to fashion, photography, videography, architecture, poetry—really any medium that re‑creates the human experience. Design is a reification of life itself: we take our experiences, emotions, traumas, and memories and pour them into whatever medium we’re working with. That’s why Steve Jobs talked so much about taste; it’s not just *seeing* what to do—great work rewires who we are, then that new wiring shapes our expression.

Design is more than boxes, palettes, and grids. It’s integral to the human story, and it matters. We shape design, and design shapes us.

I’m an eclectic. I steal inspiration from magazines, runways, films, albums—because all of them spring from the same root: giving form to lived experience. Pretending those worlds can’t cross‑pollinate would be naive.

> Ultimately it comes down to taste. It comes down to trying to expose yourself to the best things that humans have done and then try to bring those things in to what you're doing.  
> — *Steve Jobs*

Not everyone can be a designer. It takes taste, exposure, and ruthless execution. Taste is trained: years of studying what you love, figuring out **why** it works, and getting feedback until your intuition sharpens.

> I just have very specific tastes and I know what I like, from my toothbrush to my wardrobe. Everything is very simple, very basic. I only have one of everything, but it's the one I like the best. And wherever I go, I curate a very similar space—somewhere between spare and minimalist. It's kind of random, but a good‑looking chaos.

The best designers design everywhere. They tweak an ad’s colors, arrange their room, plan their outfits, script their morning routine. They care about *everything* that’s put into the world, because meaning hides in the details. Love forces you to confront the whole person—good and bad—and great design demands the same wholehearted attention.

When I look back, I realize what captivated me wasn’t just how things looked but the sense that someone cared. Great design bonds functionality with feeling, utility with beauty, user with creator. My goal is to recreate the feeling I had booting up that PS3: something built with passion, love, and the pursuit of greatness.
