title:  "How I Think About Problems - Part 0"
---

How I Think About Problems will be a series of posts in which I challenge myself to write about a mental model I use to solve problems. I use five main problem solving frameworks where I have anywhere from great to decent proficiency in. I am going to challenge myself to write about the chosen framework for one hour straight without looking at any notes. This can be anywhere from an explanation of the framework to examples, etc. 

<br>
The point of this series is to 1) challenge myself to recognize where I need to improve in terms of problem solving and using these frameworks efficiently and 2) show off my problem solving style and skill. Point 2 exists to communicate to others how I use Thinking and how I might operate in a work-like setting. 

<br>
Hopefully any readers of this series can come away with either a greater understanding of these frameworks or a critique they have in mind they would like to share with me. I am of course always looking for blind spots and feedback, so feel free to reach out if you have any commentary.

<br>
In the future, I am sure the five frameworks I use most will differ from the ones I will write about in this series, as most of them are sort of introductory/basic. Nevertheless, they are effective for high quality thinking.

The first framework I will go over is Systems Thinking (wow, so unique) which will be Part 1.
