Subject has 2 path ways 
	- Attachment to a reality that does not exist
	- Attachment to the reality that does  exist
Usually, the pull of the reality that does not exist is stronger than actual reality (same mechanisms as porn and fast food?)

The pull is stronger because of lots of different reasons such as survival needs, confirmation bias, trauma based thinking, security, insecurity, fear, anxiety, psychological disorders, etc.

The imagined reality is not reified, thus making it obsolete

In both realities, we can never fully comprehend them as they truly are because of the limited scope of the mind

The actual reality is the reification of the transjective experience 

Both actual reality and the made up reality are preceded by maps
	maps -> territory
	The map of the fake reality has a stronger pull

Beauty, truth, and goodness

Beauty *is* because truth and goodness are
Truth and goodness *matter* because beauty is
A *coevolution*

Beauty requires the axioms of truth and goodness (though, beauty is not emergent simply *because* of truth and goodness)

Truth and goodness only exist in actual reality

Thus making beauty reliant on actual reality 

only in truth and authenticity can beauty, truth, and goodness find meaningful expression.

Not getting attached to realities that do not exist is important because truth, beauty, and goodness all lie in actual reality. All realities are preceded by maps coming from the subject, these maps are not actual reality.
