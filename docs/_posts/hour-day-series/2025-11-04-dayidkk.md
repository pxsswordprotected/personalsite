It's been a while since my last post. I've been busy with school, family, and halloween stuff, but alas my habit has not kicked. I'm still working everyday towards my goal. Today I spent around 2 hours going over Full Stack Open. I'm on Part 2 Section D now. Surprisingly, I've found React highly enjoyable to learn. I think it's because both it's quite intuitive and easy (so far), and the syntax feels satisfying to code in. Idk why I enjoy arrow functions so much but I do.

My learning system still looks around the same. Get principles and fundamentals from full stack open page -> ask Claude to give examples and go into more depth across different problem spaces-> I ask for exercises with no to minimal help and code them on my own. LLMs are still boosting my learning speed and their helpfulness is insane. It's like having a full time tutor along my side (since I know fundamental learning skills!).

One thing I have been concerned about is my lack of design. I haven't touched design in a while, making my skills rusty. To counteract this I want to start studying good design and exploring more fundamental rules to great design that I haven't touched upon yet. I won't be able to practice much (the most important part), but the input is still invaluable and will help a lot in the long run.
