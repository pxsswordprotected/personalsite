Today I spent about an hour going over the intermediate section of The Odin Project. I was a bit less focused today because of certain factors, so I got less done than I wanted to. I went over topics like units and SVGs, just learning, not much practice. "Even if you play your cards in the statistically optimal way, you will not win every hand. So itâ€™s important to stay consistent and not let a single bad outcome derail a good overall trend." Onto the next day then.
