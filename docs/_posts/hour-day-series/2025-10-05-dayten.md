title:  "One Hour a Day of Design Engineering - Day 10 & 11"
---

Friday and Saturday were days 9 and 10. Today was Sunday so I took a small break for the day, which I did last week; though I did do around 10 mins of practice. Days 9 and 10 were spent on grids. They are a big concept with lots of info to go through so I probably need to spend 1 more day with them before I move on. My intuition in the context of actual syntax/practical application is still kind of low. Also, grids are the last concept in the 'Intermediate HTML and CSS Course' on The Odin Project platform, so I need to figure out what I'm going to do next. My plan for now is to move onto the 'Advanced HTML and CSS' section as it doesn't require JS. After that is completed I will move onto learning JS (using <a href="https://javascript.info/" target="_blank">javascript.info</a>), then React. I feel this gives me a great intuition and feel for using HTML/CSS first before moving onto a whole new tech like JS. Based on knowledge scaffolding and principles to effective learning (s/o Math Academy), this seems like the right move.
