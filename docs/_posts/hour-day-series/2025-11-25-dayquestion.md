It's been a long time since my last post. But worry not, I've still been working hard. I finished full stack open a while ago and have learned a bit of tailwind, tho definietly not good at it yet. Today I sat down and designed some product for 2-3 hours. I forgot how good designing feels. It feels so natural to me, like alignemnet. Sure some things I do not enjoy, but even then I can find the wonder in those moments. It's a reminder as to why I'm learning this stuff. Automatic skills feel wonderful. I want to engineer like I can design, like my brain works when I am designing.

Today it hit me that design feels much more natural for me as I've been doing it since I was young, maybe 12-13 years old. In Photoshop, video editing, it's all the same. It's all iterating on aesthetics to a certain point of enjoyment. That's all it really is, just lots of experiments and iterations done within a state of play. But alas, restraints might prevent that from happening like bottlenecks in skills, but that too is a skill issue which can be learned. How wonderful.

Anyways, I'm still going. It's still enjoyable. I haven't been perfect about the habit but I have been consistent which is really what matters. Just doing the thing every day. School work and getting to the end of the semeste has held me back, along with other distractions, but that too is a skill issue which can be overcome. Thanks for reading <3
