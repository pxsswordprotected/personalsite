Today was day 16 and yesterday was day 15. I've been doing review both of these days for a few hours each day. I also did some learning and practicing with new psuedo-classes. My workflow has been like this: give NotebookLM everything I've learned so far (my notes) -> ask it to give me a review over one or many subjects I would like to practice -> read review with some spaced repetition -> feed the review into Claude and ask it to give me a mini project to do on my own -> do the mini project -> ask Gemini/Claude for hints and feedback. I also cooked up a nice prompt for deliberate practice which has been effective to use as well. <br> <br>
Honestly I think this has been extremely helpful because now I feel like I've gained a much deeper intuition about everything I've learned. Sure my skills aren't completely 100% mastered but they're a lot stronger now.

I have realized that there are still some things I need to learn within CSS to truly have a deep understanding of it before moving on to JS. These things include (but not limited to) animation stuff, different properties ,and more  pseudo-elements. However the list is not long and I'll only need to do 3-4 more days of learning/review and I will finally move onto JS.
