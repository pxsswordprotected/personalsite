Well, I've started learning React. Spent about 4-6 hours total going through Full Stack Open, about the same workflow as when learning HTML/CSS. However, I am making sure to be a bit more diligent in my learning with React as it's kind of an "end all, be all" point in which React is such a massive Thing that I have a feeling that I definitely am better off mastering the fundamentals before anything else. I wouldn't say this is totally different from what my learning has been like, just that it differs in its intensity. I want to make sure I get it right and have the fundamentals down to truly be the best I can be.
