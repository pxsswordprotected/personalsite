series_name: One Hour a Day of Design Engineering

Today was day 9, and I did about 1.5 hours of more practice with forms. I will need to do a bit more practice with them before I move on, tomorrow should be the last day I need with them if I spend my time wisely. Today was not my most productive, but that's fine. One bad day doesn't mean much in the face of an indestructible habit.
