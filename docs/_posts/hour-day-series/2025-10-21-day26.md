Between today and yesterday, I spent around 9-10 hours learning JS. Today was more of the work load, around 6 hours. I've been using javascript.info to grind through the learning using LLMs as an accelerator. My workflow looks like: choosing a concept (based on evaluation of knowledge graphs + LLM research), feeding the javascript.info page into Gemini, asking Gemini to churn out the most important fundamentals and aspects of the concept, take notes, then ask Claude for quizzes and exercises. Gemini's part exists as to present me with the same concepts from javascript.info, but in a manner as to not cognitively overload my brain, and for the info to be presented in bite sized pieces that are in a format to easily practice and take notes on. Info bloat is real and often javascript.info will contain too much noise. The point is for me to sift out the real fundamentals from the tacit knowledge that I'll pick up along the way, actually DOING the material. Reading about tacit knowledge is mostly useless as a beginner since your intuition for the technicalities is so low, it will just breeze past your head (for the most part). Anyways, this was a great 2 days, and I'm finally happy to be done with schoolwork for now so I can grind.
