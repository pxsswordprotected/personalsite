Unfortunately I have not had too much time to dedicate to my practice due to school + family related things, but I've still been trying. Today I did an hour of learning and the other two days I got in 30 min for each day. Obviously not ideal, but better than nothing. It feels "bad" missing so much time. That's how I know the habit has been built up. I don't want to miss all this time, but sometimes it happens. Either way, in the long run the end results will still be the same. I'm still going over CSS but by next week or even this week I should definitely be moving on to JS. I want to learn a bit more CSS stuff and practice more though. I find myself in this trap of seeing new advanced stuff I have not learned yet, but I'm not totally sure when to move on. But by now, I have the fundamentals down well so I feel confident.
