series_name: One Hour a Day of Design Engineering

---

Today I spent about 1.5 hours learning the rest of flexbox and its related concepts, as well as practice. It was about 3/4 time spent in practice and 1/4 learning. I had a bit of less energy today due to longer classes so I could not get as much done, but that's perfectly fine. Tomorrow I'm starting the intermediate HTML and CSS section in The Odin Project. My learning workflow will probably stay the same (as laid out in <a href="https://www.psswordprotectd.com/2025/09/23/dayone/" target="_blank">day 1</a>).

<hr>
<blockquote>designers who are creative (expressive), technically knowledgeable (able to execute), tasteful (+craft), empathic, and hard-working are the best but rarest combination, because these qualities counterbalance one another. There are only a few hundred such designers in the world.</blockquote>

I read this tweet today and I could say it's another way of viewing my end goal. I want my personal aesthetic taste and preferences to shine in my work, I want to be a domain expert, and I want to connect with others through design in meaningful ways (+money). I really do believe my taste and work has the potential to shape and influence things in big ways, the work just needs to be done :)
