Today was Monday, yesterday was Sunday, and I skipped Saturday. Total probably about 5.5 hrs across both days. Spending time on async/promises/await/callback stuff for async tasks and actions. It's probably the most "confused" I've been on this journey so far, but it's not too hard. The concepts are just a bit abstract and harder to keep in my head at a single point in time for actual use. The biggest thing for me is just breaking the problems down into small, fundamental pieces that I can go through bottom-up. Despite this, I probably will only need to spend another week on JS. This studying habit is so built up for me now that I don't really feel like doing much else (other than my other habits). Skill building is very rewarding and it sucks to just leave slack on the table for something else that is volatile like phone usage or watching TV, etc that will not do much for me long term comparatively. Anyways, still grinding and going at it. JS is fine, easy enough. I still would say I enjoy HTML/CSS more so far since the results are more tangible and immediate and it targets aesthetics (at this point anyways).
