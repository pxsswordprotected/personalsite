Today I spent around 4 hrs studying and did a bit of practice with concepts that felt hazy. I learned some new things such as functions and custom properties which seem highly useful. Custom properties seem especially useful for design systems, I wonder how connected the two are in the "real world". I suppose this is a question I could do a bit of research on now, but I don't see the point. I'll save that for when it is important and actually useful to my skill level, I don't want that info to bog down my fundamentals right now.
