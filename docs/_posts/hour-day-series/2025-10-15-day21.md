Yesterday I spent around 1-1.5 hour going over various topics in CSS like transforms and the basics of animations. Did some practice there but not much. There's certain things I've been going over recently that deal with CSS that seem more like specific details I'll only need to know once I need them. Not that I shouldn't learn them right now, but these concepts don't need to be as deeply engrained as true fundamentals need to be. 
<br><br>
Today I did around 2 hours of reading and practicing two books: Don't Make Me Think & The Non Designer's Design Book. Both of these are quite popular and I can see why. They cover fundamentals concisely and practically. DMMT has been more useful than TNNDB since it's a bit more in depth, but still self explanatory in a lot of parts. My workflow for these books looks like using NotebookLM to generate reviews of principles and ideas laid out, I then import the review (after turning the review into flashcards) into san LLM and ask it to make me some problems I can sketch out on a notepad to solve. I also ask LLMs to generate questions using the concepts laid out in the books using example questions rather than pure theory. This workflow has been nice and allows me to iterate quickly and really get the concepts grokked. It's been nice to turn to actual design learning a bit since I've been doing more technical stuff these past 20 days. It also made me realize that oh wait you really don't learn this design stuff just from an engineering path, huh. Hence why skill stacking engineering with design can be so useful.

Here's a (bad) preview of the work done:<br>
