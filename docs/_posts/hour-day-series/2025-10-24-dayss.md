Same old same old these past 3 days going through and learning JS user javascript.info. Have spent about 1-3 hrs each day learning and working. Workflow still looks the same, learning in bite sized pieces, quizzing myself, doing practice problems, learning fundamentals first, etc etc. The Math Academy way you know. Right now I'm up to the "Promises, async/await" section. I'll only be learning the parts I need to learn for React (for now, I'll probably have to revisit some things down the line), as to save time and go a bit breadth first before fully depth first. It's been a tiny less motivating learning JS just because unlike HTML/CSS, there's not really immediate results that are tangible. I mean they're are, in code, but to me it's not that valuable yet. So what I've been doing is asking an LLM how a concept I'm learning might relate to design engineering or React or something else in the future, and that's been helpful for my brain to see the connections and long term vision of what needs to be learned and why. That way, it doesn't feel like I'm learning nothing, and it's actually like "oh yea this stuff will be important, I just need these fundamentals first."
