title: "How To Use LLMs"
---

Where I just list a bunch of techniques and prompts.    

One must possess the <i>will to think</i> in order to maximally leverage the effective use cases of LLMs.    

<blockquote cite="William Shockley">
  <p>Motivation is at least as important as method for the serious thinker. The essential element for successful work in any field was "the will to think". This was a phrase he learned from the nuclear physicist Enrico Fermi and never forgot. "In these four words," Shockley wrote later, "[Fermi] distilled the essence of a very significant insight: A competent thinker will be reluctant to commit himself to the effort that tedious and precise thinking demands -- he will lack 'the will to think' -- unless he has the conviction that something worthwhile will be done with the results of his efforts." The discipline of competent thinking is important throughout life.</p>

<ul>
<li>It's very helpful to have the right context such as giving multiple ideas for the LLM to use rather than use its own. LLMs tend to default to not-so-good frameworks.</li>
<li>Ask to search your past week of chats and have it quiz you over things you learned.</li>
<li>Give 2-4 specific ideas that might have connections and ask what those connections are. </li>
<li>Ask what first principles the last output was based on.</li>
<li>Thinking in writing feedback loops: present an idea you write, ask for feedback, write more, ask for feedback..... (especially helpful if you have uploaded files and want to specifically work with that knowledge) </li>
<li>Present an argument and for the strongest steelman against it.</li>
<li>Present an argument and ask it to identify weak spots and assumptions. </li>
<li>Present an argument and ask it to identify possible emotional motivations/blind-spots instead of pure logical errors. </li>
<li>Ask what mental models are most useful to deploy for the problem at hand and why</li>
<li>Ask for psycho-active questions to ponder about (and how it came about those questions)</li>
<li>Ask what things you would have to encounter to make your idea false</li>
<li>Ask for examples in different domains</li>
<li>Give it a text you are about to read and ask it to generate some psycho-active questions you should ponder before reading</li>
<li>Ask for ways to use the information in real life and actually do the things</li>
<li>Ask for many iterations of a request rather than just one good one</li>
<li>Describe the effect you want rather than the thing you want</li>
<li>Give examples of what you like and ask it to identify the underlying patterns, then apply those patterns to something new</li>
<li>Ask it to explain what's _not_ true that sounds like it should be true given what you just learned</li>
<li>Ask about edge cases</li>
<li>Describe a decision you're stuck on and ask what information would make the decision obvious</li>
<li>If you're not getting what you want, paste its response back and explain specifically what's missing or off</li>
<li>For complex tasks, ask it to first outline its approach and check with you before executing</li>
<li>Ask it to explore 3 different branches of the last output by tinkering with different variables</li>
<li>Ask it to imagine a future where the current idea or plan has failed catastrophically and why</li>
<li>Request the model to show its work or think step-by-step before providing the final answer</li>
<li>Ask to generate a thesis, anti-thesis, and synthesis of different arguments</li>
<li>Ask for multiple framings of the same problem from completely different angles</li>
<li>Ask what adjacent problems share similar structure</li>
<li>Request analogies from domains you'd never think to connect</li>
<li>Ask to identify second and third order effects of an idea</li>
<li>Request confidence levels on claims and what evidence would shift them</li>
<li>Request what the model is most uncertain about in its response</li>
<li>Ask to convert abstract concepts into specific implementations or experiments</li>
<li>Ask to translate between mediums (concept to diagram, text to code, framework to checklist, etc)</li>
<li>Request what downstream problems get easier if get this one right</li>
<li>Ask for open-ended quizzes forcing you to think in writing</li>
<li>Ask to identify the 20% of the problem that drives 80% of the outcome</li>
<li>Present your reasoning step-by-step and ask it to identify weak spots</li>
<li>Ask for it to give you a harder problem you have to solve using the same first principles</li>
<li>Request an explanation of why the code works, not just that it works</li>
<li>Paste unfamiliar code and ask to trace through execution with a specific input</li>
<li>Ask what logging or console statements would most quickly isolate the problem</li>
<li>Ask to review your code as if it were a pull request, focusing on maintainability not just correctness</li>
<li>Ask what mental model experienced developers use when thinking about [thing]</li>
<li>Paste an error message and ask to explain what the system is actually complaining about, not just how to fix it</li>
<li>Present a problem or concept and ask what first principles are needed to understand or solve the thing</li>
<li>Present a thing and ask what first principles are at play</li>
<li>Ask what concepts from other fields describe the same underlying dynamic</li>
<li>Ask what emotional or identity-based reasons might make certain conclusions feel more appealing to you</li>
<li>Ask for a concrete situation where you'd actually use this and what the trigger to remember it would be</li>
<li>Meta: ask what prompts from this list would be helpful in the current context of your conversation</li>
<li>Ask to generate a knowledge graph/skill tree you can systemically climb in the context of learning something new or developing a skill.</li>\
<li>Export some relevent data and ask the LLM for any useful patterns/knowledge.</li>
<li>Describe a skill you're trying to build and ask what deliberate practice exercises would target your specific weak points.</li>
<li>Ask what questions a domain expert would ask about your idea that a beginner wouldn't think to ask.</li>
<li>Give it some info and ask it to generate a questionnaire or worksheet based on the info, then have it analyze it.</li>
<li>Describe a pattern you've noticed and ask whether it's a real regularity or a coincidence shaped by selection bias.</li>
<li>Ask it to generate a "what would have to be true" ladder for a goal, breaking the goal into the necessary conditions stacked underneath it.</li>
<li>State a goal and ask what specific, observable evidence would tell you you're making progress.</li>
<li>Ask what the load-bearing assumptions are in your worldview on [topic] and what happens if you remove each one.</li>
<li>Ask what part of your confusion is genuine uncertainty vs the mind refusing to look at something it already knows.</li>
<li>Describe a stuck situation and ask: "What if the stuckness is not a bug but the output of a system that's working exactly as designed? What is it optimizing for?"</li>
<li>Ask what the maintenance costs are of a belief or commitment you hold, not just the benefits.</li>
<li>Make sure you are aware of framing/anchoring biases in LLMs. The way you frame a question to it will shape its answer entirely. Ask it to not just provide confirmation bias for your prompt, but rather genuine whole thinking like a normal human.</li>
