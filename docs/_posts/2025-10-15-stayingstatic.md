title:  "On Staying Static"
---

Staying static seems very uncomfortable to me now. Upskilling is extremely rewarding and feels great to constantly have things to move through. I'm currently upskilling a few things that take up my time including meditation and design engineering. I guess it's because I'm young now, but it's hard for me to imagine myself at 50 NOT upskilling in some way, even if it's just using my skills effectively. <br> <br> Static is boring. <br> <br> You can upskill in any area. Watching films, social skills, reading, sleeping, any of it can become a skill and you can improve upon it with learning, experimentation and iteration. I guess this has always been my style, just not as applied now. I think certain factors like meditation and emotional work has allowed me to start to embody this mindset much easier now and act on it in more areas. For instance, it's much easier to intentionally improve social skills when you're less reactive to thoughts and sensations (meditation helps w/ this).

I think experimentation is a big factor here. One thing that might be happening with people who are stuck in a static mindset is that of fear due to failure and other related emotional reactions. But adopting a mass experimentation mindset really rewards you for going from results driven to process driven. All of it is data, failure is just more info to iterate on. You can learn from it always. For instance, if I feel failure from something, info I could learn is that the Self is strong in [this] area, there's some type of fear going on, I'm probably shaming myself somewhere, etc (and this is just the emotional aspect).

Anyways, static is boring. Don't be static. Be alive, learn, be active, annihilate yourself and what you think you are to effectively iterate.
