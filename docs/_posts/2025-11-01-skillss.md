title: "General High ROI Skills For Life"
---

There are some skills that if you get good at them, they will make everything else easier and better.

Here's imo a (almost) full list in order of ROI:

<a href="https://www.justinmath.com/files/advice-on-upskilling.pdf">learning how to learn</a> (including mastery and expertise)

experimentation and iteration

health (sleep, exercise, diet)

meditation (assuming this also helps with improving focus)

"mastering" emotions and emotional regulation

social skills + connection

communication (writing + speaking)

metacognition

mental models

general financial stuff

The highest ROI skills tend to be ones that (1) compound over time, (2) apply across many domains, and (3) create multiplicative rather than additive benefits. For example learning how to learn doesn't just make you 10% better at some things, it 2x's your rate of improvement in everything else.
