Unfold through compounding daily effort using experiments and iterations.
<br><br>
Unfolding is letting reality reveal to you the path you should take rather than forcing a fantasy you imagined in isolation.
<br><br>
Compounding is the accumulation of small lessons from daily experiments that stack up over time to create a result far smarter and better than anything you could build in a single day.
<br><br>
Even 30 minutes a day will get you ahead.
<br><br>
Experiments are how you ask reality a question.
Iterations are how you adjust your behavior based on the answer.
<br> <br>
If you stop experimenting, you stop getting feedback. If you stop getting feedback, you are back to living in isolation.
