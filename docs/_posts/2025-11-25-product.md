Unfold through compounding daily effort using experiments and iterations.
<br><br>
Unfolding is letting reality reveal to you the aligned path you should take rather than forcing a fantasy you imagined in isolation.
<br><br>
Compounding is stacking small lessons from consistent effort to build a result better than anything you could build in one day.
<br><br>
Even 30 minutes a day will get you ahead.
<br><br>
The shorter the gap between action and feedback form reality, the faster you compound.
<br><br>
Experiments are how you ask reality a question.
Iterations are how you adjust your behavior based on the answer.
<br> <br>
If you stop experimenting, you stop getting feedback. If you stop getting feedback, you are back to living in isolation.
