title: "Success In One Sentence"
---

Compound daily effort using experiments and iterations optimizing for a state of alignment.
<br><br>
Let reality reveal to you the path you should take rather than forcing a fantasy you imagined in isolation.
<br><br>
Experiments are how you ask reality a question.
Iterations are how you adjust your behavior based on the answer.
<br> <br>
If you stop experimenting, you stop getting feedback. If you stop getting feedback, you are back to living in isolation.
