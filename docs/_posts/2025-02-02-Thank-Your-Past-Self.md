title:  "Thank Yourself After Hard Work"
---

What's the first thing you might do after someone does something for you? You say thank you, of course (or at least I would hope so, [nothing is owed to you](https://www.psswordprotectd.com/2025/01/22/Existential-Endowment/)
). 

There can be three different versions of ourselves we can observe at a time: our past self, our current self, and our future self. All three of these play a vital role in our lives, and one cannot be discounted no matter what. Even if you think your past self is cringe or dumb or low iq, it doesn't really matter considering the decisions your past self made all have accumulated into what you are now. One can argue for determinism, free will compatibilism, etc. but at the end of the day, your past self and the decisions it made are significant.

So, since we can take the view that there are three different versions of ourselves existing at once, it makes sense to view them just as you would like another human being you love and respect. Because of this, always thank yourself for your hard work and sacrifice. 

For example, if I choose to meditate for 10 minutes instead of scrolling Twitter, at the end of the meditation session, it is vital you thank your past self for choosing to meditate instead of choosing the easy option that probably would have had no positive upsides to it. Your past self chose the hard thing. It made a sacrifice of short-term pleasure for long-term satisfaction. Thank it for that, and make sure you really mean it. Truly indulge in the fact that if your past self had not made that decision, you would not have gained the benefits and instead gained the losses of the doing the lower-order activity. 

I believe this is beneficial for a few reasons. Number one, it allows us to view discipline and motivation as a natural arising phenomenon. It is not something you will have to force, but instead, it will become much easier for good decision making as your gratitude will shine through the façade of fictitious discipline. Number two, it allows us to be much more compassionate and loving within ourselves and for ourselves. I like to think gratitude plays a massive role in Love, so naturally arising gratitude for our sacrifices allows us to recognize the fruits of our labour with a lens of love as well as repetition. Number three, it allows for positive feedback loops for higher-order decision making. If you know you’ll later be thanking yourself for a decision, you’re more likely to choose actions that future-you will appreciate. Your current decisions are more carefully weighed because you anticipate your future gratitude.

Treating your past, present, and future selves (though we only talked about our past self here in an isolated way) with the same kindness you would offer a loved one cultivates discipline, compassion, and integrates gratitude into your life. Instead of forcing yourself to “be motivated,” you create an environment where positive choices arise more naturally and thanking your past self is a powerful way to keep that cycle going.
