title:  "Simplicity Begets Action"
---

"Simplify, simplify, simplify" is a principle I live by. This is because simplicity begets action. Simplicity begets action because it reduces cognitive load and reduces friction to get from point A to point B. 
<br><br>
Miller's Law, stated by George Miller in 1956, states that the average human can hold only about 7±2 (between 5 and 9) items in working memory at once. This is a fundamental cognitive constraint on human information processing.
<br><br>
Graicunas' Law (R = n(2<sup>n/2</sup> + n − 1), where R is total number of relationships and n is total number of Things) describes the exponential relationship between the number of subordinates and the complexity of management relationships. If you're not dumb you can draw parallels from management relationships to everyday things. 
<br> <br>
Both of these ideas work together to support the principle of simplicity. Miller's Law provides a cognitive limit that explains why Graicunas' exponential complexity becomes unmanageable, while Graicunas' Law explains what happens mathematically when you exceed those limits.
<br> <br>
Graicunas' Law mathematically proves that adding "just one more thing" is never just adding one thing. That single addition creates relationships with every existing element, and those elements now have new relationships with each other through it. This exponential complexity tax applies whether you're managing people, building software, choosing what to eat, or making any life decision involving multiple interacting components.
<br> <br>
The simplicity principle is essentially a strategy to avoid exponential complexity growth by keeping n (the number of elements) as small as possible, which keeps R (total complexity) manageable. The reason these things become unmanageable is because of both time and cognitive load (Miller's law). 
<br> <br>
This can be applied to anything. Software you make, the food you eat, your daily routine, all of it. 
<br> <br>
All of this culminates into more action because you spend less time thinking and planning, there is less friction, and less decision fatigue. This is supported by the <a href="https://modelthinkers.com/mental-model/paradox-of-choice" target="_blank">Paradox of Choice</a>. 
<br> <br>
When overwhelmed by options, people experience decision fatigue, anxiety, and either make no choice at all or settle for a default option they regret. Different explanations play into this like fear of making the wrong choice, decision fatigue, increased regret, and time pressures. 
<br> <br>
In the end, the answer is clear: simplicity begets action.
