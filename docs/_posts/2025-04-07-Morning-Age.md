title:  "A Morning Meditation On Aging"
---


One day when I awake, my hands will be frail and wrinkly.

One day when I awake, my body will not move as it does now.

One day when I awake, my friends and family will not be as they are now.

One day when I awake, I'll be not be as I am.

One day, I will be frail and old, unable to think as I do now, unable to see as I do now, and unable to express myself as I can now.

I am 90 years old in the circle of time but I somehow woke up young again, what a blessing.

I rest in my health this morning, as if I just drank from the fountain of youth and now get to experience the Divine again. 

This morning is a second chance, a do-over that allows me relinquish my regrets and embrace my youth.
<br>
<br>

What a blessing.

Notes:

To get the best out of this practice, actively visualize what these things might feel and look like. Rest in the moment with complete relaxation and feel the volatility. 

This practice might not be that effective if you're not comfortable with volatility yet or get upset thinking about it.
