        <p class="intro-text">I'm currently working on design and research focused on the convergence of AI and human-Computer interaction.
            My work explores the future of Human-AI interaction, focusing on designing technology that emphasizes good aesthetics and innovation.
            I also write about different topics such as spirituality, advice, design, and other topics on my blog. 
            I also like music, fashion,(really just any creative visual pursuit), reading, nature, 
            and other things that are interesting.  
            If you're reading this, I am always looking for new people to connect with, feel free to reach out.
