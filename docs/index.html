        <p class="intro-text">I am currently working on design research, focused on the intersection between AI and Human-Computer interaction. My focus is how we can design better technology and interfaces to allow for innovative and efficient interactions. I also write about different topics such as spirituality, advice, design, and other topics on my blog. I currently reside in Texas and plan on moving somewhere else (not yet decided) after I complete my college courses. If you're reading this, I am always looking for new people to connect with, feel free to reach out. </p>
