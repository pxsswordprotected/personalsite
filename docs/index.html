        <p class="intro-text">I am currently working on both design and research, focusing on the intersection between AI and Human-Computer interaction. 
            My work addresses designing better technology and interfaces for innovative, efficient, and aesthetically pleasing interactions.
            I also write about different topics such as spirituality, advice, design, and other topics on my blog. 
            I currently reside in Texas. I'm looking to move within the next 2 years. I also like music, fashion,(really just any creative visual pursuit), reading, nature, 
            and other things that are interesting.  
            If you're reading this, I am always looking for new people to connect with, feel free to reach out. </p>
