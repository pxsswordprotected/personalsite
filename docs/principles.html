              Make habits as easily accessible as possible. Reduce friction
              wherever and whenever possible. Conversely, if you want to stop a
              bad habit, put as much friction as possible between you and the
              habit. This can include mental and physical friction.

              "Ultimately it comes down to taste. It comes down to taste. It

              you're doing." - Steve Jobs

              Context determines value. The same object can be worthless or
